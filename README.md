## Section 1 - Overall Summary

**Employee Rating: Strong**

### Employee Rating Comment

This year presented significant challenges as we transitioned to a new company structure and workflows, which impacted many of our ongoing projects. Despite these challenges, I remained committed to delivering high-quality outputs, often going beyond the scope of my responsibilities to ensure both team continuity and successful project outcomes.

I took ownership of several key initiatives, such as the Flash Expansion and continued support for our RAP (Rapid Analytics Platform) projects. I worked closely with enterprise groups to facilitate a smooth transition, adopting new data management processes and optimizing workflows to minimize disruption. Additionally, I led training sessions for new and existing team members, helping to accelerate onboarding and build familiarity with tools like PowerBI, Azure Data Factory, and RAP notebooks. My focus on developing reusable datasets and robust data pipelines has supported the wider goal of ensuring reliability and maintainability across projects.

Throughout the year, I have made significant contributions to maintaining a high standard of analytics output, particularly in improving data quality checks, deploying scalable BI models, and managing deployment pipelines effectively. My proactive involvement in governance and security initiatives, as well as aligning our BI capabilities with architectural standards, has been instrumental in pushing our projects forward.

Overall, my performance has been defined by adaptability, cross-functional collaboration, and a proactive approach to overcoming technical challenges in a shifting environment.
