## Section 1 - Overall Summary

**Employee Rating: Strong**

### Employee Rating Comment

This year presented significant challenges as we transitioned to ICE systems and workflows, particularly as it relates to BI tooling and capabilities. Despite these challenges, I remained committed to delivering high-quality outputs, often going beyond the scope of my responsibilities to ensure both team continuity and successful project outcomes.

I took ownership of several key initiatives, such as the Flash Expansion and continued support for existing RAP projects. I worked closely with enterprise groups to facilitate a smooth transition, adopting new data management processes and optimizing workflows to minimize disruption. Additionally, I led training sessions for new and existing team members, helping to accelerate onboarding and build familiarity BI tooling and RAP notebooks. My focus on developing reusable datasets and robust data pipelines has supported the wider goal of ensuring reliability and maintainability across projects.

Throughout the year, I have made significant contributions to maintaining a high standard of analytics output, particularly in improving data quality checks, deploying scalable BI models and managing deployment pipelines effectively. My proactive involvement in governance  as well as aligning our BI capabilities with architectural standards has been instrumental in pushing our projects forward.&#x20;

Overall, my performance has been defined by adaptability, cross-functional collaboration, and a proactive approach to overcoming technical challenges in a shifting environment.

## Section 2 - Goals

### 1. Allocate 51% towards CAPEX Projects

- Contributed 63% of working hours towards CAPEX projects exceeding the original goal. This includes further development of RAP notebooks, enhancing datasets, improving spark job robustness and capability, as well as expanding analytics beyond McDash data (i.e. IMT/encompass data).



### 2. Complete Flash Expansion

- Successfully expanded the Flash data product to include additional attributes. This included historical backfill and addressed downstream dependency impacts. Additionally changed the Flash data model, decreasing the volume of data by 10% without sacrificing resolution and detail, as well as simplifying queries in majority of cases (\~90%). For the remaining \~10% of cases that required logic changes, I worked with clients to provide them with optimized solutions to address the specific category of analytics that were impacted.  



### 3. Onboarding at Least 5 New Servicers to Flash and Enhance Boarding Process

- Boarded 8 servicers as of November 2024 and will board additional servicers on 12/1/24.  Enhanced onboarding process for Flash with improved logging and identifying and resolving loan match async issues.



### 4. DataOps, Monitoring and Tooling Improvements

- Developed and implemented McDash-specific modules and functions (such as the mcdash.utils library) to enhance RAP file system operations, streamline monitoring, and manage UI state effectively, resulting in improved efficiency and maintainability.&#x20;



## Section 3 - Questionnaire

### 1. What do you consider your 3 greatest strengths? How could you leverage these in the coming year?

- **User Experience Focus**: My focus on the end-user experience helps improve the usability of our products and processes. I plan to leverage this by continuing to refine RAP notebooks, ensuring that our analytics outputs are intuitive and actionable for end users.
- **Mentoring and Knowledge Sharing**: I actively mentor team members, share knowledge, and support their growth, which strengthens the team’s overall capabilities. This year, I will continue to lead regular workshops and one-on-one sessions to upskill team members on full stack BI planning & development as well as development practices for data science & analytics.
- **Holistic Technical Approach**: I balance both high-level strategic thinking and detailed technical implementation, which allows me to simplify complexity and reduce future technical debt. I plan to apply this by further developing reusable data assets, creating scalable solutions, and ensuring that our workflows align with best practices in data engineering and BI.

### 2. What skills and abilities would you like to put to greater use?

- I would like to take on more control over the full stack required for delivering solutions, enabling me to drive projects end-to-end. 

### 3. Thinking of your long-term career goals, please note any training, on-the-job experience, and management support which would help you reach your goals and improve your effectiveness.

- I am looking for opportunities that allow me to work with a clear strategy and well-defined responsibilities, where I can take on leadership tasks and contribute to impactful decision-making while still being involved in the technical implementation of solutions. 

### 4. Please provide any additional comments here.

- I would appreciate clarity on exact role requirements to better align my strengths and experiences with the expectations. This will help ensure that I can make a maximum contribution, particularly in areas such as BI product evolution, advanced analytics, and full-stack solution delivery.
